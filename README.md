## Stories

* [x] Add items to list
* [x] Remove items from list with a long press
* [x] Tap item to launch a new screen for editing (and save changes back from here)
* [x] Persist items through relaunch of app in SQLite (using the ActiveAndroid ORM)
* [x] Uses a custom cursor and adapter that plays well with our SQLite ORM
* [x] Support due date and priority. Changing the priority changes the background color of the ListItem (while preserving the Lollipop ripple effect!).
* [ ] More tweaking of the style improving UI/UX, colors, images, backgrounds. Better pickers for dates and priorities (super hacked together right now).
* [ ] Use DialogFragment instead of new Activity

Time spent: 3 hours + 5 hours
